            <h3>About</h3>
            <p> Ciao! Welcome to my website!
            <p> 
I am a second-year Ph.D. in Economics at <a href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/gigh6797-1.661797">Stockholm University</a> and a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://www.su.se/institute-for-international-economic-studies/"> Institute for International Economic Studies</a> (IIES). 
<p>         
I am interested in understanding how culture and identity shape peopleâ€™s economic and social behavior, with a specific focus on the evolution of social norms and human capital investments in both developed and developing settings. 
<p>
I earned a MSc in Economic and Social Sciences from <a href="https://www.unibocconi.it/en"> Bocconi University</a> and a MRes in Economics from the <a href="https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/department-of-economics"> European University Institute</a>. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked for several years as a Field Coordinator for ERC and J-PAL funded RCTs in the domain of development and education.
