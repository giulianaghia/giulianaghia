 # About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. in Economics at Stockholm University and a Research Assistant at the Institute for International Economic Studies (IIES).
I am interested in understanding how culture and identity shape peopleâ€™s economic and social behavior,  with a specific focus on the evolution of social norms and human capital investments in both developed and developing settings.
Before starting my Ph.D., I worked for several years as a Field Coordinator for ERC and J-PAL funded RCTs in the domain of development end education.
